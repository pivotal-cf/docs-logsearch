This document describes whether and how to scale PCF Log Search.

## <a id="need"></a>Do You Need to Scale Up?

Search for all logs in Kibana. If you see a gap in recent logs as in the image below, then Log Search is falling behind indexing and you need to scale up your cluster or [reduce resource usage](#resource-usage).

### <a id="scale-up"></a>Scale Up your Cluster

1. Navigate to the **Status** tab of the PCF Log Search tile.

1. Examine the **Elasticsearch Data nodes**:
  1. If the load is high, especially if **CPU** > **50%** or **PERS DISK** > **70%**, click the **Resource Config** section and add Elasticsearch data nodes, following the table below as a guide.
  1. You may also need to increase the number of **Log parser** nodes. As a general rule, you should have slightly more Log parser nodes than Elasticsearch Data nodes.

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Log volume</td>
          <td>Elasticsearch Data nodes</td>
          <td>Log parser nodes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>200 / second</td>
          <td>2 x medium.mem (~8GB RAM) with 50GB persistent disks</td>
          <td>2 x small (1 CPU)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2,000 / second</td>
          <td>~10 x xlarge.mem (~32GB RAM) with 200GB persistent disks</td>
          <td>~15 x medium (2 CPU)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10,000 / second</td>
          <td>~30 x xlarge.mem (~32GB RAM) with 500GB persistent disks</td>
          <td>~40 x medium (2 CPU)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

## <a id="ha"></a>Maintain High Availability

To ensure high availability, you must have an odd number of Elasticsearch Master nodes. You can run multiple copies of all jobs except Queue, Router, Cluster Monitor and Maintenance.

## <a id="resource-usage"></a>Reduce Resource Usage

Cloud Foundry produces a large amount of logs. As a result, Log Search can consume significant resources. Use the following strategies to reduce the amount of resources consumed by Log Search. 

1.  **Reduce the retention period**: Shorter retention periods dramatically reduce the amount of disk resource required.
2.  **Index less data**: If you attached to the Elastic Runtime firehose, application logs probably make up a large portion of the total logs indexed. Follow these steps to index less data:
  1. Search for `tags:LogMessage` in Kibana to show logs from apps running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 
  1. [Create a Visualization](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/visualize.html) based on the `cf.app_id` field to reveal any apps that produce a disproportionaly high number of log entries.
  1. Reduce the logging verbosity of the apps identified above.
